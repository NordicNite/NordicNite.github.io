    <h1>The Crystal Method</h1>
    <h4>Basic History</h4>
    <p>The Crystal Method is an American electronic music and keyboardist duo formed in Las Vegas, Nevada by Ken Jordan and Scott Kirkland in the early 1990s. Like The Chemical Brothers, Fatboy Slim, and The Prodigy, they were and still are pioneers of the big beat genre. The Crystal Method's music has appeared in plently of Television shows, films, video games, aswell as advertisements. This site will be giving details on both of the founders aswell as some of their albums/works between the 1990s and the 2000s. </p>
    <p>By the early '90s, both Ken Jordan and Scott Kirkland had moved from Las Vegas to Los Angeles. Ken and Scott bought a house together, in La Crescenta, Glendale, California, which had a small underground shelter beneath the front lawn. Originally intending to turn the shelter into a studio, it proved to be an unrealistic idea and the duo built up a studio in their house which was located near a 210 freeway overpass. They subsequently named their studio The Bomb Shelter. They were interviewed on the front lawn of the house in the documentary "Better Living Through Circuitry".</p>
     <p> After The Bomb Shelter was built, a tape of The Crystal Method's music found its way to a British DJ named Justin King. King was interested in starting a record label that would showcase American electronic dance acts. King teamed up with a Scot named Steve Melrose to form the record label City of Angels. The first official release from the City of Angels label was The Crystal Method's "Now is the Time". The Crystal Method were signed to Outpost Recordings in 1996.</p>
